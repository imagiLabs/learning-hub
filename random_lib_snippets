# Example 1 for random.randrange()

import random as r 
# To use the random module, you have to import it into the beginning of your coding project. 
# When you use functions from the library, you have to indicate that the function you are calling belongs to the random library. 
# If you don't want to keep typing out random before all your functions, you can also import libraries as a shorter name so it is more efficient to use them, in this case you have to type: import [name of library] as [shorter chosen name] as you can see above.

for i in range(0, 8):
	m[i] [r.randrange(0, 7)]
	# the third parameter is optional, in this case itâ€™s automatically set to 1
  
# Example 2 for random.randrange()

number = r.randrange(0,10) # you can choose any range here since we will display it as a string
scrolling_text(str(number))

# Example for random.randint()

for i in range(0, 8):
	m[i] [r.randint(0, 7)]
  
# Example for random.choice()

fruit = ['apple', 'pear', 'peach', 'banana', 'cherry', 'watermelon']
scrolling_text(r.choice(fruit))

# Example for random.shuffle()

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
r.shuffle(letters)
scrolling_text(letters)
